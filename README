Program to examine which distribution of units with fixed income is most likely to win a battle in tripleA

Set simulation values in config.py

Run army_generator.py to generate and save the possible unit distributions for 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400
    IPC amounts for land and sea battles

Run battle_simulation.py to perform the battles between possible armies as specified in config.py
    (If the list of possible armies hasn't been generated yet, also generate and save it)

Run analysis.py to analyze the results of the battles for the configuration specified in config.py
    (If the results and/or list of possible armies haven't been generated yet, also generate and save them)

units.py defines the unit types and properties. New units can be added by adding an entry in the "units" dict.
    Damaged versions of units with multiple hit points are generated automatically.

loss_policies.py defines the different orders the AIs can choose to lose units.
    Currently only one exists. More may be implemented in the future.
